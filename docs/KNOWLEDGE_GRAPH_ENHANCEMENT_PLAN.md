# Knowledge Graph Visualization Enhancement Plan

## 1. Project Context

The pr-2-graph project transforms GitHub PR conversations into interactive knowledge graphs, providing visual insights into multi-agent collaboration. Building upon our successful Phase 1 implementation with SQLite triple store and basic D3.js visualization, we now aim to significantly enhance the visualization capabilities.

## 2. Current Limitations

The existing visualization has several limitations:
- Basic force-directed layout with limited visual differentiation
- Simple tooltips with minimal metadata
- Limited interactivity and drill-down capabilities
- No timeline or evolution tracking
- Performance challenges with larger graphs
- Limited semantic representation of complex relationships

## 3. Enhancement Goals

### 3.1 Visual Representation
- Variable node sizing based on importance metrics (contribution volume, centrality)
- Enhanced color scheme for node types and relationship categories
- Custom node shapes/icons for information density
- Visual clustering of related nodes
- Improved edge styling with directional indicators

### 3.2 Interactivity
- Detailed drill-down panels for node/edge exploration
- Collapsible/expandable node clusters
- Interactive filters for focusing on specific graph aspects
- Multi-level zoom with semantic detail adjustment
- Search and highlight capabilities
- Context-sensitive actions for nodes and edges

### 3.3 Timeline and Evolution
- Timeline visualization for repository evolution
- Graph state snapshots at key milestones
- Animation capabilities to show knowledge graph growth
- Diff visualization between graph states
- Event markers for significant moments

### 3.4 Data Model Extensions
- Multi-dimensional relationship attributes
- Confidence scoring for extracted relationships
- Temporal metadata for evolution tracking
- Enhanced semantic categories beyond basic triplets
- Support for nested and hierarchical relationships

### 3.5 Performance Optimization
- Efficient rendering for 1000+ node graphs
- Progressive loading for complex visualizations
- WebGL acceleration for larger datasets
- Client-side caching strategies
- Optimized force-directed layout algorithms

## 4. Technical Implementation Plan

### 4.1 Component Architecture
- Extract visualization into modular components:
  - GraphVisualization (core container)
  - NodeRenderer (node styling and interaction)
  - EdgeRenderer (edge styling and labels)
  - DrilldownPanel (detailed exploration)
  - TimelineView (evolution visualization)
  - FilterControls (interactive filtering)
  - GraphStatistics (metrics and analysis)

### 4.2 Development Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Visualization Enhancement (2 weeks)
- Refactor existing D3.js implementation
- Implement enhanced node/edge styling
- Add basic drill-down capabilities
- Improve tooltips with rich metadata

#### Phase 2: Advanced Interactive Features (2 weeks)
- Develop collapsible clustering
- Implement detailed sidebar for exploration
- Add search and highlight capabilities
- Create filtering system

#### Phase 3: Timeline and Evolution (1-2 weeks)
- Build timeline component
- Implement graph state snapshots
- Develop animation transitions
- Add event markers

#### Phase 4: Performance and Polish (1 week)
- Optimize rendering for large datasets
- Implement progressive loading
- Add final styling and refinements
- Complete testing suite

### 4.3 API Extensions

We'll need to extend the backend API with:
- Enhanced metadata endpoints for visualization
- Timeline data retrieval
- Filtered graph queries
- Performance-optimized graph export formats

## 5. Testing Strategy

- Visual regression tests for graph rendering
- Performance benchmarks with large datasets
- User interaction test scenarios
- Browser compatibility verification
- API integration tests

## 6. Success Metrics

The enhanced visualization will be considered successful when:
- It can effectively visualize 500+ node graphs with good performance
- Users can extract insights through interactive exploration
- The visualization accurately represents complex semantic relationships
- The system maintains backward compatibility
- The visualization provides clear evolution tracking across PRs
