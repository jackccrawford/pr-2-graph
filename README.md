## üåü Overview

**pr-2-graph** is an open-source tool that analyzes GitHub Pull Request conversations and transforms them into interactive knowledge graphs. Perfect for understanding team collaboration patterns, identifying breakthrough moments, and visualizing complex problem-solving flows.

### ‚ú® Key Features

- **ü§ù Multi-Agent Analysis** - Designed for human-AI collaboration patterns
- **üß† Semantic Relationship Extraction** - Identifies ANALYZES, IMPLEMENTS, FIXES, REVIEWS relationships  
- **üìä Interactive Visualizations** - D3.js physics-based graphs with hover details
- **üîç Breakthrough Detection** - Spots novel insights that changed conversation direction
- **üéØ Role Analysis** - Distinguishes between strategic analysts, implementers, and coordinators
- **üìà Pattern Recognition** - Learns what collaboration styles produce the best results

## üè† Architecture

### üîß Core Components

- **üìã Analysis Engine** (`app/core/analyzer.py`) - Main PR conversation analysis
- **üîó GitHub Integration** (`app/services/github_service.py`) - Fetch PR data from GitHub API
- **üß† Knowledge Graph Builder** (`app/models/graph.py`) - Construct nodes, edges, and relationships
- **üîå Relationship Extractor** (`app/services/graph_service.py`) - Semantic relationship detection
- **üé® Visualization Engine** (`app/exporters/`) - Interactive D3.js graphs and static exports

### üìå Extensible Design

Built with modularity in mind:

1. **üîå Pluggable Analysis** - Add new relationship extractors
2. **üé® Multiple Export Formats** - D3.js, PNG, SVG, JSON, GraphML
3. **‚öôÔ∏è Configurable Rules** - Customize relationship detection patterns
4. **üîó API Integration** - Works with any GitHub repository

## üéØ Use Cases

### üìà For Development Teams

- **Team Retrospectives** - "How did we solve this complex issue?"
- **Onboarding** - Show new developers how experienced teams collaborate
- **Process Improvement** - Identify patterns that lead to faster problem resolution
- **Knowledge Transfer** - Visualize how expertise flows through the team

### üî¨ For Researchers

- **Human-AI Collaboration Studies** - Analyze how AI agents work with human developers
- **Software Engineering Research** - Study communication patterns in distributed teams
- **Collaboration Pattern Analysis** - Identify what makes teams successful

### Extracted Relationships

The plugin identifies these types of semantic relationships:

- **Participant Actions**: `Cascade ANALYZES authentication_issue`, `Devin IMPLEMENTS message_parsing_fix`
- **Temporal Relationships**: `Comment_5 REPLIES_TO Comment_4`, `Fix_Applied FOLLOWS Problem_Identified`
- **Problem-Solving Chains**: `Authentication_Issue CAUSES Server_Errors`, `Message_Format_Fix RESOLVES API_Errors`
- **Technical Relationships**: `Flutter_App INTEGRATES_WITH TIN_API`, `JWT_Token AUTHENTICATES API_Calls`

## API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /api/plugins` - List all available plugins

### Repo to Graph Plugin Endpoints

- `POST /api/plugins/repo-to-graph/analyze` - Analyze PR conversation
- `GET /api/plugins/repo-to-graph/graph/{analysis_id}` - Get knowledge graph

```

## Test Results

### tin-sidekick PR Analysis

Successfully analyzed the tin-sidekick PR #1 conversation with:

- **30 Comments** from 3 participants
- **90 Knowledge Graph Triplets** extracted
- **Participants Identified**:
  - Devin (AI Flutter Specialist) - 12 comments
  - Jack/Cascade (AI Backend Specialist) - 18 comments
- **Issues Detected**: Authentication Flow, Message Format, API Parsing, Duplication, Debug Execution
- **Solutions Identified**: Message Format Fix, API Parsing Fix, Authentication Fix, Duplication Fix
- **Relationship Types**: ANALYZES, IMPLEMENTS, PROVIDES, REPLIES_TO, RESOLVES

### LLM-Enhanced Analysis

With the new LLM-powered backend:

- **Asymmetric Relationship Types**: DIAGNOSES_ROOT_CAUSE, CONFIRMS_THROUGH_TESTING, VALIDATES_SYSTEMATICALLY, PROVIDES_BREAKTHROUGH
- **Breakthrough Moment Detection**: Identifies novel insights that changed conversation direction
- **Confidence Scoring**: Based on insight novelty and impact rather than keyword presence
- **Participant Role Analysis**: Strategic analyst vs implementation specialist vs coordinator
- **Interactive Visualization**: D3.js physics-based graph with hover details and drag functionality

## Future Plugin Ideas

The extensible architecture supports additional plugins such as:

- **Code Analysis Plugin** - Analyze code changes and patterns
- **Performance Metrics Plugin** - Extract performance-related insights
- **Collaboration Patterns Plugin** - Identify team collaboration patterns
- **Issue Resolution Plugin** - Track issue resolution workflows

## Contributing

To add a new plugin:

1. Create a new file in `app/plugins/`
2. Implement the `BasePlugin` interface
3. Register the plugin in `app/main.py`
4. Add appropriate tests
